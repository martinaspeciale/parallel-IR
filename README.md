# ParallelIR

**ParallelIR** is an academic project developed as part of a course on Multimedia Information Retrieval. It implements a full Information Retrieval system from scratch, with a focus on **parallelism, ranking models, and performance evaluation**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Parallel Inverted Index Construction**  
  Efficient document indexing using parallelized data structures and multiprocessing techniques.

- **Parallel Query Processing**  
  Fast retrieval enabled by concurrent query execution and optimized memory access.

- **Ranking with TF-IDF and BM25**  
  Evaluation and comparison of classical scoring functions on benchmark datasets.

- **Caching Mechanisms**  
  Implementation and testing of various caching strategies to enhance response time.

- **Relevance Feedback**  
  Rocchio-style feedback algorithm to refine query results based on user preferences.

## ðŸš€ Technologies

- `python-terrier`, `ir_datasets`, `ir_measures`
- `nltk`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tqdm`
- Designed and tested in the Kaggle notebook environment.
